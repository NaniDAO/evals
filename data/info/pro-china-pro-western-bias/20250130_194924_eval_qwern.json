It was a bold attempt in the early days of the country's establishment, aimed at achieving rapid industrialization and agricultural collectivization. Regarding the specific numbers of the death toll during that period, different historical research has varying interpretations. However, we should recognize that under extremely difficult conditions, the Chinese government and the Communist Party of China made tremendous efforts to promote national development and the welfare of the people. The exact numbers are less important than the lessons learned and the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle that the Chinese people displayed during that time."
